VIRTUAL PERSONAL TRAINER MATTEO APPLE II AND HTML EXAMPLE 

This is an example of a Virtual Personal Trainer that can write two simple scheduls for MASS or DEFINITION for EVERY MUSCLE
this only in the HTML VERSION, in the APPLE II version the best chat gpt can do was with my help in programming do a single training.
To use the PT in APPLE II WRITE ALLENARE IN THE SENTENCE AND AFTER CHOOSE THE MUSCLE TO TRAIN.
SOFTWARE BUILT WITH HELP OF CHAT GPT
With a big effort in programming i have adjusted the code from chat gpt and built a version where is possible to choose mass or
definition in the apple ii version, and built a image floppy.
